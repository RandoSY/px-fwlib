The button GPIO pin (PC9) is configured as an input with pull-up enabled.
The EXTI peripheral is configured to generate an interrupt when a falling
edge (button press event) is detected on line 9. The `EXTI4_15_IRQHandler()`
function is called to handle external interrupts 4 to 15 and it clears
the interrupt flag for external interrupt 9. The interrupt wakes up the
processor core and the LED will be flashed before it goes back to sleep.
