# Basic GPIO example # {#NUCLEO64_L053_EXAMPLE_GPIO}

This is a basic GPIO example for the ST Nucleo64 L053R8 board. It is the 
embedded equivalent of a "hello world" program on a PC to kick the tires and 
know that your development setup works.

The LED flashes at a slow 2 Hz while the 6/NO button is released and at a fast 
8 Hz while the button is being pressed.
