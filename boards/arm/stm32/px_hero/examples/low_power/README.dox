# Low Power STOP Mode Example # {#HERO_BOARD_EXAMPLE_LOW_POWER}

This demonstrates how to put the STM32 into STOP low power mode.

File(s):
- boards/arm/stm32/px_hero/examples/low_power/src/main.c

The following modules are used:
- @ref BOARDS_STM32_PX_HERO
- @ref STM32_GPIO

The STM32 is woken up from low power STOP mode while the 6/NO button is pressed.
The LCD displays an incrementing counter value that tracks the number of times
that the button has been pressed. The external peripherals (Serial FLASH, LCD 
and LCD backlight) and specific GPIO pins (SD Card detect, UART2,  I2C and 
UART4) are put into the lowest power state to minimise power consumption.
