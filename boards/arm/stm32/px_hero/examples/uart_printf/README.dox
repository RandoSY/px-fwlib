# UART printf ("hello world") example {#HERO_BOARD_EXAMPLE_UART_PRINTF} #

This is a serial port example for the Hero Board. It is the embedded equivalent 
of a "hello world" program on a PC to kick the tires and know that your 
development setup works.

UART1 is configured to 115200 BAUD, 8 Data Bits, No Parity and 1 Stop Bit.
The stdio (standard input / output) stream that is part of the C Standard 
Library is redirected to use UART1.

The string "Hello World!" is sent and then any bytes received is echoed back.
