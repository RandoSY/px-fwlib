Here is my list of recommended tools:

- [SlickEdit] [slickedit] :
  A commercial editor that will make a massive improvement in your productivity!
- [Ikalogic ScanaPLUS] [ikalogic] logic analyzer :
  A great value-for-money multi-platform logic analyzer with a multitude of 
  protocol decoders (UART, I2C, SPI, LIN, CAN, 1-Wire, ...) that is essential
  for rapid driver development and debugging. Once you start using a logic 
  analyzer, you will realise the insanity of driver development "in the dark" 
  and kick yourself for wasting so much time before!
- [UnixShellUtils] [unix_shell_utils] : 
  a minimal collection of Unix Shell utilities (make, sh, echo, rm, etc.) and 
  other utilities (SRecord) used to build projects using advanced Make scripts.
- [Tera Term] [tera_term] : 
  Free terminal emulation software to interact with CLI applications and upload 
  new firmware via bootloader using XMODEM-CRC protocol.
- [7-Zip] [7z] : a file archiver with a high compression ratio.
- [Tortoise SVN] [tortoise_svn] : 
  a Microsoft Windows Explorer GUI plugin for Subversion (a free version control 
  system that manages file and directory changes over time).
- [Doxygen] [doxygen] : 
  a tool that generates documentation from source code.
- [Atmel Studio] [atmel_studio] : 
  an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing and debugging Atmel
  ARM Cortex and AVR microcontroller applications on the Microsoft 
  Windows operating system. It includes the GNU GCC build toolchain for C and 
  C++.
- [MSYS2] [msys2] : a collection of GNU utilities such as bash, make, gawk and 
  grep to allow building of applications and programs which depend on 
  traditionally Unix tools to be present. Note that a minimal set is provided
  with [UnixShellUtils] [unix_shell_utils].
- FTDI USB to serial converter tools:
    + [FTDI FT230XS USB-UART Bridge Virtual Com Port (VCP) driver] [ftdi_vcp_driver]
    + [FTDI FT_PROG EEPROM Programming Utility] [ftdi_ft_prog] :
      an EEPROM programming utility to modify EEPROM contents (including settings 
      like device descriptors, pin configurations, ...) of FTDI devices.
    + [FTDI CDM Uninstaller] [ftdi_uninstaller] :
      Uninstaller to remove old drivers.
    + [FTDI Ignore Hardware Serial Number Registry Editor Utility] [ftdi_ignore_ser] :
      a utility that edits the Windows registry to ensure the serial number 
      descriptor of each FTDI device is ignored during driver installation. This 
      feature ensures any FTDI device connected to a USB port is given the same COM 
      port number.
